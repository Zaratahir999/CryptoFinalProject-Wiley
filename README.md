-Cryto Final Project-

The T2 crypto app is a revolutionary application designed to simplify the cryptocurrency investment experience for individual investors. Developed efficiently using Java, this app has been brought to life in a short time frame to address the complexities faced by users when managing multiple digital assets across various exchanges. With the goal of providing a seamless and user-friendly solution, the app employs CRUD operations to fetch data from a secure database, while also integrating with a trusted third-party API to access real-time coin data and essential information.


-Requirements-
For the final course project, you will create a web-based application using tools and skills learned throughout the course and present the project to the rest of the class when the project is complete.

The completed project will demonstrate your ability to plan and write code effectively. As such, it must meet the following standards:

The code must be well-organized, using a MVC approach.

Use flowcharts and/or UML diagrams to organize code.
Use wireframes to plan out your GUI interface.
The code must be organized in an object-oriented style.
Use proper naming conventions consistently for all variables in the app.
Be sure that each layer communicates with other layers appropriately.
The application must include functional unit testing for each part of the application.

The application must include testing for all CRUD operations.
Implement testing using JUnit 5 or another Java testing suite.
The application must demonstrate the appropriate use of error handling.

The application must include custom error messages and implement them where appropriate.
Error handlers must be in the appropriate packages.
The application must use Spring tools to build and organize the code.

Use Spring DI and appropriate @Annotations in the code.
The application must include a database.

If you are using a relational database, such as MySQL:
Use an ERD to describe the database.
The database must use appropriate tables and fields.
The database must be normalized to at least 2NF; 3NF preferred.
Create and submit a schema .sql file to create the database and a data .sql file to add data to the database.
If you are using a non-relational database, such as MongoDB:
Provide documentation that describes the type of data included in the database.
Include a JSON file with examples of the data included in the database.
The application must use JDBCTemplate or JPA to perform CRUD operations on data using appropriate REST API endpoints.

At a minimum, the application must include endpoints to Create, Read all, Read by Id, Update by Id, and Delete by Id.
Include server data validation before writing data to the database.
Other endpoints may be needed based on the goal of the application.
The application must include a frontend GUI interface to interact with the end user.

The frontend may be written in JavaScript, jQuery, React, or Angular.
Implement data and form validation.
The application must use a version control system for code.
